# Alphabet Soup Funding Success Predictor

## Overview

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup is seeking a tool to help identify applicants with the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. By applying machine learning and neural network techniques, this project builds a binary classifier to predict whether an applicant funded by Alphabet Soup will achieve a successful outcome. This model will help Alphabet Soup make data-driven decisions to optimize the allocation of their funds.

This project was developed and executed using **Google Colab**, providing a cloud-based environment for efficient data processing and model training.

## Dataset

Alphabet Soup has provided a dataset in CSV format, containing over 34,000 records of organizations that have received funding in the past. The dataset includes various metadata columns that describe each organization:

- **EIN** and **NAME**: Identification columns for each organization.
- **APPLICATION_TYPE**: Type of application submitted to Alphabet Soup.
- **AFFILIATION**: Affiliated sector or industry.
- **CLASSIFICATION**: Government classification of the organization.
- **USE_CASE**: Purpose for which the funding was requested.
- **ORGANIZATION**: Type of organization (e.g., non-profit, corporation).
- **STATUS**: Organization's active status.
- **INCOME_AMT**: Income level classification.
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**: Whether there are special considerations for this application.
- **ASK_AMT**: Funding amount requested by the organization.
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL**: Target variable indicating whether the funded project was successful.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Clean the dataset and prepare it for modeling.
   - Handle categorical variables by applying encoding methods to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identify and scale relevant numerical features.
   - Optimize the dataset by handling null values, outliers, and redundant information.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Develop and train a binary classifier using neural networks to predict the success (`IS_SUCCESSFUL`) of applicants.
   - Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
   - Perform adjustments and improvements as needed to enhance the predictive power of the model.

## Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning utilities for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Building, training, and evaluating the neural network model.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment for developing, running, and sharing the project.

## How to Use

1. **Preprocessing**: Use the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab to load, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Train the neural network model on the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test set and review performance metrics to understand its accuracy and predictive capability.
4. **Optimization**: Experiment with model parameters to achieve optimal performance.

## Results and Insights

Upon completion, this project provides a model capable of predicting the likelihood of success for applicants funded by Alphabet Soup. This classifier will support Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team in making informed, data-driven decisions regarding future funding allocations.

## Future Improvements

Potential future directions include:

- Enhancing feature selection to further refine input data.
- Testing additional machine learning models for comparison.
- Developing a deployment pipeline to integrate the model into a live decision-making tool.
